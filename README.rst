Python micro web-framework and asynchronous networking library, support Python 3.x


Our goals
=========

- It was designed to work on Python 3.x
- Some of syntax were inspired on Tornado's syntax
- Tornado is the default server, but Eventlet is stable as well
- Templates are done by **Jinja2**
- HTML5 as the big-main-thing
- Work friendly with NoSQL (otherwise we should stop talking about them)
- Handle asynchronous requests properly
